Lifepoints does not collect or process any data. We physically can't. We don't have any servers in order to do so.

Lifepoints allows you to interact directly with the Todoist API via your browser.

Lifepoints is a web frontend SPA (Single Page Application) hosted via GitHub Pages and served over HTTPS.

Our SPA does not import any third party assets (inc. scripts/css/images).

Lifepoints stores your Todoist API token in your browsers local storage.
